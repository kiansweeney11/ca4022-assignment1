## Kian Sweeney

Code for first assignment of CA4022: Data at speed and scale. This assignment
involved taking a movie lens dataset and cleaning it using Pig before running
analysis queries through Pig and Hive.

## Scripts
All our pig and hive scripts can be found in the root directory of our repo.

## Data Folder
The data folder contains the data files used for this experiment. It also contains
a python script used to determine the unique genre values in the genres column.
This file is called "genres.ipynb".

## Images Folder
This folder contains proof of outputs attained in this experiment executed on
my hadoop cluster. The files are named accordingly with regard to each question
they address.
